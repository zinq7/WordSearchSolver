# WordSearchSolver
to use:
- download zip
- extract
- go to location and run .jar (java -jar .\WordGameSolver.jar)
- type 16 chars and win

Alternatively, if the program runs really slowly (which it will), you can seriously decrease use by altering the File path from wiki-500k to 10k or 100k. Keep in mind this may remove possible words.
